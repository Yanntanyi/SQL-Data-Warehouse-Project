# SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Hi, I’m Yannick Tanyi, and this repository contains my personal **Data Warehouse & Analytics project**. I built a Data Warehouse in SQL Server from start to finish—loading raw data, automating ETL jobs, designing fact and dimension tables, and writing SQL queries to pull out useful insights.

In this project I set up ETL processes to import and transform data on a schedule, modeled the warehouse using star schemas so reporting is straightforward, and wrote SQL queries and simple dashboards to track key metrics. This is my end‑to‑end example of how I approach data engineering and analytics—perfect for my portfolio and any time I want to show how I turn raw data into insights.

## Project Requirments 

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
I built a modern data warehouse in SQL Server to bring together sales data from multiple systems and make it easy to run reports that support smarter business decisions.

#### My Specifications

- **Data Sources**: I imported CSV extracts from an ERP and a CRM system.

- **Data Quality**: I cleaned and resolved issues (missing values, inconsistent formats) before loading anything into the warehouse.

- **Integration**: I combined both sources into a single, easy‑to‑use star schema optimized for analytical queries.

- **Scope**: I focused on the latest snapshot of each table—full historization wasn’t needed for this project.

- **Documentation**: I wrote clear data‑model diagrams and descriptions so both business stakeholders and analytics teammates can understand how everything fits together.

This setup shows exactly how I approach a data engineering challenge from end to end.

## About Me

Hi there! I’m Yannick Tanyi, a senior at the University of Chicago double‑majoring in Economics and Data Science (and soon off to start my MS in Applied Data Science). I’m passionate about making data both practical and accessible—whether that’s teaching high school students the basics of analytics, building NLP models to automate workflows, or designing dashboards that help stakeholders make smarter decisions. Feel free to explore this project to see how I bring together engineering, modeling, and analysis in one end‑to‑end solution!
